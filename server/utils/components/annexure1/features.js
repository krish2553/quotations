    "KHX Series Hoist and Trolley enables True Vertical Lifting with low headroom dimensions.",
    "Trolley and bridge travelling motions comes to rest with gradual decrement of 2 speed steps when approaching towards the end stops (Fast-Slow-Stop).",
    "DC spring applied Fail-Safe brake for hoisting, trolley and bridge travelling motion",
    "Limit switches for Overload, Over-Hoisting, Over-Travel, Anti Collision when two crane in same bay is provided. Along with protection of under voltage, over voltage and phase sequence.",
    "Revolving Beacons with hooter for all motion is provided.",
    "Coupling less design for trolley.",
    "Unmatched high operational speeds across all motions ensure quick and safe lifting and shifting, enabling efficient and fast material handling for optimized productivity.",
    "Equipped with Dynamic Sync Technology*, featuring dual power transmission units for perfectly synchronized cross-traversing motion, ensuring load stability, reduced mechanical stress, and enhanced energy efficiency. This improves safety, reduces maintenance, and extends the equipment's lifespan.",
    "Noise levels during hoisting without load are approximately 70 dB at a 6-meter height, measured under typical ambient conditions inside a shed, accounting for standard workplace/environmental noise.",
    "4/1 Reeving reduces the radial load on drum hence enhancing the life of gearbox elements and drum bearing. The 4/1 reeving configuration can be easily converted to 2/1 reeving in rare cases, such as change in operating conditions or special conditions, effectively doubling the lifting height to adapt to new requirements without significant modifications.",
    "Cranes are equipped with heavy duty track system and energy chain system for current collection of movable pendant and power/control cable respectively for cross traversing.",
    "The modular design not only ensures flexibility and functionality but also enhances the workspace with its aesthetic appeal, creating a visually pleasing and organized environment.",
    "Under Bridge Lights x 2 Nos for DG Cranes (NA)",

  "Standard Series Hoist": [
    "Standard Series Hoists are designed for general-purpose applications with optimized lifting speeds.",
    "Robust steel housing ensures protection in indoor environments.",
    "Failsafe electromagnetic brakes ensure immediate holding at any lifting stage.",
    "Thermal protection built into motors for safety and long life.",
    "Pre-configured limit switches for safe end travel and lifting boundaries.",

  "Crab/Trolley": [
    "Crab unit supports dual-speed travel across bridge length for precise load placement.",
    "Equipped with grooved rope drums and hardened gearboxes.",
    "Long-travel powered by double motors with inverter control.",
    "Accessible maintenance layout for brake, motor, and gear housing.",
